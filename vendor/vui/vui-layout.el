;;; Commentary:

;; The pure layout core behind vui's responsive containers (issue #134).
;; Everything in this file is a pure function over integers, plists and
;; lists of strings: no buffers, no vnodes, no measurement, no vui
;; runtime.  That boundary is deliberate - it is what makes the core
;; testable in isolation and reusable outside vui (see the shared-seam
;; exploration in https://github.com/yibie/textui/issues/1).
;;
;; Vocabulary:
;;
;; - A SPEC describes one child's width constraints, as a plist:
;;   :natural N  measured natural width (required, non-negative)
;;   :min M      floor the child may shrink to (default: natural,
;;               i.e. not shrinkable); a floor above the natural
;;               width raises the width the child occupies, like
;;               CSS min-width
;;   :grow G     weight for distributing surplus width (default 0)
;;   :rigid t    never shrink below natural, even alone on an
;;               overflowing row (content that renders at one width
;;               and cannot re-render narrower: `vui-flex' marks every
;;               static child rigid, only width-receiving function
;;               children shrink)
;;
;; - A PLACEMENT is the result for one child: (:row R :column C
;;   :width W), in source order.  The core returns geometry; the
;;   consumer renders its own children into it.  Composing strings from
;;   placements is `vui-layout-compose'.
;;
;; - A BLOCK is a rendered rectangle: a list of lines (strings).
;;
;; Widths are unit-agnostic integers: measure content in cells and the
;; result is a cell layout, measure in pixels and it is a pixel layout.
;; The core never measures; even `vui-layout-compose' measures and pads
;; through caller-supplied functions (cells by default).
;;
;; Semantics (matching, where sensible, the engine in yibie/textui so
;; conformance comparison stays meaningful):
;;
;; - Partition: children fill a row while they fit at their minimum
;;   widths, in source order; the next child starts a new row.  A row
;;   is never empty, so an oversized first child still gets a row.
;; - Allocation: when naturals fit, surplus goes to growers
;;   proportionally to weights; when they do not, the deficit shrinks
;;   children proportionally to their capacity (natural minus min),
;;   never below min.  A lone child whose minimum exceeds the row is
;;   clamped to the available width unless it is rigid.
;; - Composition: a block wider than its assignment widens its column
;;   for the whole row, deterministically, instead of breaking
;;   alignment (the assignment is a target; overflow never truncates).
;; - Grid: equal integer tracks with the remainder on the earlier
;;   tracks; the column count falls with the available width, never
;;   below one; children fill rows in source order, so the final row
;;   may be incomplete.
;; - Height is content-driven: a row is as tall as its tallest block.
